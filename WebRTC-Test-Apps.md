We are working hard on interoperability. We believe interoperability is one of the most important factors if OpenWebRTC is going to be interesting and useful. The WebRTC API is complex and maintaining interoperability is an ongoing process.

**If you notice issues in WebRTC applications that do not work correctly with OpenWebRTC, please send us a link to the application or application code or whatever you can so that we can try to identify either what is incorrect in your application or in OpenWebRTC.**

# Simple Camera Test

One of the first things to test is whether you can get a video stream from your camera. You can do this with a simple [getUserMedia test app](http://googlechrome.github.io/webrtc/samples/web/content/getusermedia/).

# Point-to-point Audio/Video Test

Our simple peer-2-peer demo app is live at [http://demo.openwebrtc.io](http://demo.openwebrtc.io). The app runs on node.js and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/EricssonResearch/openwebrtc-examples).
